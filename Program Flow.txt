Program Structure and Flow

The program has 2 main parts: Client and Server.

	Clients store the client's websocket request and username.

	The server does the heavy lifting of the program. It handles the sending of messages and the broadcasting of messages to their intended recipients.

Program Flow

	A remote client makes a websocket request to the server.

	A client object is created to keep track of the request and is registered in the main chat channel.

	When a message is sent, the server recieves the message, processes it according to the type of message it is and then sends it to the appropriate recipient
